The classifiers selected to perform the predictions were 'Random Forest' and 'K-Nearest Neighbor' with both models using the default parameters. In the performance evaluation, an accuracy of 98% was obtained for both models in the validation set.  While in the training set it reached 99% for RF and 98% for KNN. The decrease in accuracy achieved by RF in the validation set suggests a slight overfitting, however, it is a tolerable value that assumes that the model still performs well on the test set.</div><br>\n",

Except for the 'Impact' and 'Harmless' intents when applying RF as a model, the results obtained for these classes were quite lower compared to those obtained for the other classes, both in the training set and in the validation set, where 0% was obtained in each metric. The model presented a very poor performance when trying to classify these two classes.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">As for tuning techniques, K-fold cross-correlation and Grid Search were applied to see if the results obtained previously could be improved. However, when looking at the results obtained with 5 folds, the performance decreased considerably reaching an average of 77% accuracy. Suggests that the model may be in overfitting. </div><br>\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">For the second attempt, the number of features was reduced to only 12 for the training set.  The classifiers used in the previous attempt, RF and KNN, were kept for this evaluation with both using their default parameters. The results obtained in the performance evaluation, the accuracy did not change from the previous attempt, reaching 98% for the RF case and 98% for the KNN for both the training and validation sets, indicating that the models continue to make good predictions for the classes.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">If we take a look at the classification report for almost all attempts, the values for accuracy, recall and f1-scores reached high percentages, around 98%. Nevertheless, the performance of the 'Impact' class was very poor in both models for the classification obtained in the validation data, with 0% for every metric (precision, recall and f1-score), indicating that the number of features selected to train both models was not sufficient to be able to correctly classify this class.<br><br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In both training and validation reports, the F1 score obtained for the classes \"Impact\" and \"Harmless\" was very low compared to the other classes. It seems that for both models, these two classes are the most difficult to classify correctly. This could be due to the fact that, the number of data selected during the splitting of the training set did not cover enough samples of these two classes, as they are the least sampled attempts of the whole dataset. </div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">After conducting multiple tests and adjusting the number of features in the training set, the results showed similar levels of accuracy. However, upon further analysis of the classification report parameters, it was found that the highest metrics for accuracy, recall, and F1-score were achieved with a number of features greater than 22. The F1-score parameter indicated that the models performed better in classifying samples belonging to the 'Impact' and 'Harmless' classes, which were more difficult to detect in almost all the tests. </div><br>"
