    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><br><b>Underfitting</b> occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance even on the training set.  One indicator used to identify this modelling error is to look at the results; if both training and validation/testing performance are poor, the model is considered to be underfitted.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><b>Overfitting</b> occurs when a model not only learns the underlying patterns in the training data, but also captures noise and random fluctuations, causing it to perform poorly on new and unknown data. One indicator used to identify this modelling error is to look at the results, if the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation or test data, it is considered overfitted.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Once these two terms have been defined, it is possible to move on to the results obtained for both models. It is important to mention that, for both tests performed with the different classifiers, the default parameters were used.</div><br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">For the <b>Random Forest (RF)</b> case, the default parameter implied the number of estimators equal to 100, and the tree depth was set to <i>'None'</i>. On the other hand, for the <b>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</b> classifier, the number of estimators was set to 5, the leaf size to 30 and the type of distance calculation was <i>'Euclidean distance'</i> (p=2), all default parameters of the classifier.</div><br>\n",

    "<b> Random Forest (RF)</b>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> In the classification report of the training and test sets, for most of the classes, accuracy, recall and F1 score are slightly lower in the test set compared to the training set. This was expected, as models tend to generalise slightly worse with unseen data. However, the drop in performance is not significant, which indicates that the model still performs well on the test set. Furthermore, the accuracy obtained for the training set was 99%, while 98% for the test set.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">As can be seen in the validation set report, the model was not able to correctly classify instances of the <i>'Impact'</i> class, performing very poorly (0%) on all precision, recall and F1 score metrics. This result could be due to the default parameters set to train the model.  Tree depth is one of the most important parameter for tuning the model, as it sets the stop condition that limits the number of splits or levels deep a decision tree can go.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">To enhance the classifier results, it is necessary to adjust the maximum depth of the decision trees when performing hyperparameter fitting for a random forest model. The <i>'weighted avg'</i> metric also showed a decrease in performance on the test set, indicating that the model does not perform as well on the test set across all classes, considering the distribution of classes. Overall, the performance metrics on the test set remain high, indicating that the overfitting is not critical. </div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">On the other hand, the classification report obtained for the KNN classifier showed a small difference between the training set and the validation set, for the test set the values obtained for each of the metrics; accuracy, recall, f1-score, were slightly lower compared to the results obtained for the training set.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> For the <i>'Impact'</i> class, the metrics derived in the training set were significantly lower compared to the validation set, for all metrics. This improvement in the accuracy, recall and f1-score parameters for the <i>'Impact'</i> class in the test set indicates that the model's predictions for this class are more accurate and reliable when evaluated with new, unseen data.  Producing a recall of 50%, which means, that the model only correctly predicted this class for 50% of the evaluated intents. </div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The difference obtained in this class for the training and validation sets suggests that the model did not sufficiently fit the <i>'Impact'</i> class during training, and then after the selection of the nearest neighbour from the test set, the model adjusted its predictions to better capture the features of the <i>'Impact'</i> class. However, it is important to note that the KNN classifier does not fit the data, it does not learn from the model, it only calculates the distance to the nearest points and selects the class according to the majority result of the nearest neighbours.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> In general, the observed results do not indicate underfitting or overfitting, in fact, the average accuracy obtained in the classification report was 99%, matching with the obtained in the calculated accuracy score (98% for both sets). The high values of the <i>'micro-average'</i> in both sets suggest a good overall performance of the model. While the <i>'macro-average'</i> values are higher only in the test set, indicating that the model performs better after calculating the Euclidean distance of each point.</div><br>\n"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">If we take a look at the classification report for almost all attempts, the values for accuracy, recall and f1-scores reached high percentages, around 98%. Nevertheless, the performance of the 'Impact' class was very poor in both models for the classification obtained in the validation data, with 0% for every metric (precision, recall and f1-score), indicating that the number of features selected to train both models was not sufficient to be able to correctly classify this class.<br><br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In both training and validation reports, the F1 score obtained for the classes \"Impact\" and \"Harmless\" was very low compared to the other classes. It seems that for both models, these two classes are the most difficult to classify correctly. This could be due to the fact that, the number of data selected during the splitting of the training set did not cover enough samples of these two classes, as they are the least sampled attempts of the whole dataset. </div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">After conducting multiple tests and adjusting the number of features in the training set, the results showed similar levels of accuracy. However, upon further analysis of the classification report parameters, it was found that the highest metrics for accuracy, recall, and F1-score were achieved with a number of features greater than 22. The F1-score parameter indicated that the models performed better in classifying samples belonging to the 'Impact' and 'Harmless' classes, which were more difficult to detect in almost all the tests. </div><br>"
