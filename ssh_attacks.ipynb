    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"><b>Overfitting</b> occurs when a model not only learns the underlying patterns in the training data, but also captures noise and random fluctuations, causing it to perform poorly on new and unknown data. One indicator used to identify this modelling error is to look at the results, if the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation or test data, it is considered overfitted.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Once these two terms have been defined, it is possible to move on to the results obtained for both models. It is important to mention that, for both tests performed with the different classifiers, the default parameters were used.</div><br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">For the <b>Random Forest (RF)</b> case, the default parameter implied the number of estimators equal to 100, and the tree depth was set to <i>\"None\"</i>. On the other hand, for the <b>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</b> classifier, the number of estimators was set to 5, the leaf size to 30 and the type of distance calculation was Euclidean distance (p=2), all default parameters of the classifier.</div><br>\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> In the classification report of the training and test sets, for most classes, the accuracy, recall, and F1 score are slightly lower in the test set compared to the training set. This was expected, as models often generalize slightly worse with unseen data. However, the drop in performance is not severe, indicating that the model still performs well on the test set. Furthermore, the accuracy obtained on both sets was 99% on the training set and 98% on the test set.<br><br>\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">As can be seen in the test set, the model was unable to correctly classify instances of the <i>'Impact'</i> class, performing very poorly on all precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. This result could be caused because the parameters used to train the model were the default ones.  Tree depth is a key parameter for tuning the model, due to its relevance as a stopping condition that limits the number of splits that can be performed in a decision tree.</div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">To improve the classifier results, it is necessary to adjust the maximum depth of the decision trees when performing hyperparameter tuning for a random forest model. The <i> 'weighted avg'</i> metrics also show a decrease in performance on the test set. This indicates that the model does not perform as well on the test set across all classes, taking into account the class distribution. However, overall, the performance metrics on the test set remain high, indicating that the overfitting is not severe. </div><br>\n",
